				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After cleaning a church in flood-hit Kerala’s Alappuzha district, Sikh volunteers from Khalsa Aid are now working to clean a temple that has become inaccessible for Onam festivities. The volunteers were approached by a man working at Panayannurkavu Devi Temple, also called Panayannur Kavilamma temple,  situated at Thalavady village in Kuttanadu.</p>
<p>Gurpreet Singh from Patiala of Punjab, a Khalsa Aid volunteer, told The Indian Express, “It was Saturday when Onam festivities were underway. We were cleaning a church when a temple worker, Mohandas Prasad, came to us. He had a photograph in hand. Our translator told us that he needed help in cleaning a temple. We told him we will help soon after we are done cleaning the church. The man broke down and told us that people were unable to access the temple on Onam. We told him we will help them as soon as possible. For us, the human race is one and if we can clean a church, we can clean a temple too.”Responding to trolls on social media who criticised them for “cleaning a church, and not a temple”, Amarpreet Singh, Asia Pacific managing director, Khalsa Aid, said, “We work with the motto of ‘Recognise human race as one’. We do not select projects on the basis of caste, class, religion or gender. So when people comment that we are partial towards Muslims or Sikhs, we don’t let it affect us. Rather it makes our resolve stronger to not discriminate.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Amar Singh, a third-generation cop, made history for the Sikh community in Malaysia today when he was appointed as the chief police officer (CPO) of Kuala Lumpur,with the rank of commissioner. This is the highest rank attained by a Sikh police officer in Malaysia.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Santokh Singh was the last Sikh to be appointed as a state police chief when he was made  Selang or CPO with the rank of SAC 1.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In another appointment, Supt Baljeet Singh also received a promotion and a bump up in  rank. He has been appointed as the Pulapol Langkawi commandant carrying the rank of Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP). Pulapol stands for Pusat Latihan Police (police training centre).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">He is currently at the narcotic investigation centre at Maktab PDRM in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Amar,who had also had a stint at Pulapol Kuala Lumpur – which houses the Gurdwara Sahib Pulapol – is a third-generation cop. His maternal grandfather, Bachan Singh, was a constable in the police force. His dad, Ishar Singh, had joined later.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Amar’s dad left Punjab for Malaya via Calcutta in 1938 at the age of 18. He arrived in Penang and did odd jobs while waiting for an opportunity to join the police and posted to Sitiawan,Perak, after undergoing training, according to one news report (<em>Groomed for the Police Force</em> in The Star, 2012).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Ishar was a pioneer member of the police jungle squad which was first established during the Emergency. Squad members would stay in the jungle for up to two months at a time and shift camp in pursuit of terrorists. Ishar retired as a corporal in the Federated Malay States Police (FMSP) in 1971. He worked as a security guard in the Kinta Omnibus workshop and passed away in 1999 at the age of 80, the report adds.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Amar is a third-generation cop as his maternal grandfather, Bachan Singh, was a constable in the police force too. Bachan journeyed to Malaya as a teenager in the early 1900s. He served in among other places, Kuala Kubu Baru, Kuala Lipis and Raub, where Amar’s mother was born. Bachan retired in Klang in the 1940s.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Amar graduated with B.Sc from University Malaya (UM). He also has an LLB from the University of Buckingham, Britain, as well as a Certificate in Legal Practice.He also graduated with a Master’s in Criminal Justice from UM, and a Diploma in Syariah Law and Practice from the International Islamic University Malaysia.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Amar’s first posting was to his home town in Ipoh in the crime unit and he has had stints in Johor Baru and Klang. His last posting before his present position as Deputy KL CPO was as the 40th and only Sikh commandant of Pulapol from 2007 to2010. As head, Amar made it compulsory that all trainee officers go to their respective places of worship everyday.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Amar also insisted that all Sikh trainees tied a turban when performing their religious obligations at the Pulapol Gurdwara as “this makes you proud of who and what you are.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="font-weight: 500;">The &#8216;Flying Sikh&#8217; Who Won India&#8217;s First Commonwealth Gold</h1>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">by Rob Brown and Rehan Fazal</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em> </em><b><strong>When Milkha Singh took to the track at the 1958 Commonwealth Games in </strong></b><b><strong>Cardiff</strong></b><b><strong> most people had never heard of him. But he was to make history there and is now hailed as one of </strong></b><b><strong>India</strong></b><b><strong>&#8216;s greatest athletes.</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was the night before the 440 yards final at the British Empire and Commonwealth games in Cardiff and Milkha Singh was having trouble sleeping. &#8220;When a person makes it to the final he is under so much stress that he is unable to sleep,&#8221; recalls Singh. &#8220;It was a very difficult night.&#8221; Singh had won two gold medals at the Asian Games in Tokyo just a month before, but the Commonwealth Games were different.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No-one had heard of Milkha Singh at the Commonwealth Games,&#8221; he says. &#8220;There were competitors from Australia, England and Canada,from Uganda, Kenya and Jamaica &#8211; the athletes who took part were world class.&#8221; Continue reading the main story “Start Quote. He also had the hopes of the Commonwealth&#8217;s most populous nation weighing heavy on his shoulders. India had never won a gold medal in the history of the games.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Singh grew up in as mall village in what, during his childhood, was still British India. He would walk 10 km barefoot to school every day, crossing burning sands, and wading through two canals, his books balanced on his head. He was a teenager in 1947, when partition created the two sovereign nations of India and Pakistan. Punjab,where Singh lived, was divided between the two countries and some found themselves on the wrong side of this new border. Many Sikhs and Hindus faced persecution in Pakistan as did many Muslims in India.About half a million people were killed and millions more displaced. As Sikhs in Pakistan,Singh&#8217;s family did not escape the violence.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Terrible images of dogs and vultures scavenging on mutilated bodies still haunt Singh&#8217;s memories of that time. He remembers people were so fearful that they killed their young daughters rather than risk them being kidnapped. &#8220;My village was surrounded,&#8221; he recalls. &#8220;We were told to convert to Islam or prepare to die.&#8221; When their village was attacked &#8211; by outsiders, he emphasises,not by Muslim neighbours &#8211; Singh witnessed the murder of his parents and some of his brothers and sisters. He escaped to the jungle with a group of other boys,then managed to get on a train bound for Delhi.The trains were being searched by vigilante groups, but the boys hid under the seats in the ladies&#8217; carriage and begged the women not to turn them in. They didn&#8217;t and the boys survived.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After several difficult years living in Delhi,Singh joined the Indian Army &#8211; and it was here that his athletic prowess emerged. His instructor in the army taught him how to run properly and after coming sixth in a cross-country race against 400 other soldiers, he wass elected for further training. &#8220;All of this started when I was with the army,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I give credit to them for making me a world famous name.&#8221; In 1958, on the day of the big race in Cardiff, the athletes were taking their place on the starting line. Singh knew that the man to beat was South Africa&#8217;s Malcolm Spence. &#8220;My coach convinced me &#8211; drilled it into my head &#8211; that I could win the race regardless of whether Spence was a world class, world record holder. He was nothing before me if I ran my race as planned.&#8221; Singh with Prime Minister Jawahar lal Nehru Singh in army uniform with India&#8217;s then Prime Minister Jawahar lal Nehru</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The stadium was full but Singh remembers there were just two or three Indians among the spectators -one of those watching was Vijay Lakshmi, the sister of the then Indian Prime Minister Jawahar lal Nehru. &#8220;I said my prayers, I touched my forehead to the ground and said to God, &#8216;I am going to try my best but India&#8217;s honour is in your hands,'&#8221; Singh says. The runners took their marks and the race began. Just as his coach instructed, Singh ran the first 350 yards of the race as fast as he could &#8211; he delved deep into his reserves and took the lead but Spence followed close behind him.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While I was running, I stole a glance sideways and saw Spence just behind my shoulder. Heal most reached me but couldn&#8217;t edge past. I won the race by a margin of just half-a-foot.&#8221; The stadium erupted as Singh crossed the finish line.&#8221;Everyone was shocked at how this boy from rural India, who used to run barefoot and who had never received any training, had won gold in the Commonwealth Games,&#8221; he says. Singh had tears in his eyes as he took his place on the medal podium. India&#8217;s tricolour was hoisted up the flag pole and the anthem rang out around the stadium. &#8220;I was crying with joy and thinking to myself, &#8216;Milkha Singh,today you have truly done India proud.'&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After the race, Nehru&#8217;s sister came to congratulate him and said that her brother, the Prime Minister,wanted to know what he would like as a reward. &#8220;Back in those days we were too simple to know what to ask for and how. I could have asked for 200 acres in Punjab or two to three bungalows in Delhi.But in those times I was very embarrassed to ask for anything. All I asked was that the Prime Minister declare a day&#8217;s holiday in India &#8211; and he did.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Singh returned home to a hero&#8217;s welcome. Military bands greeted the entire Indian team at the airport and they were invited to meet Prime Minister Nehru. &#8220;Our reception was overwhelming. The Indian team was given a lot of respect everywhere,&#8221; he says. Singh continued to run for his country &#8211; he came fourth in the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome, just beaten to the bronze medal by Spence, his main rival from Cardiff. That same year, he was invited to take part in the 200 mt event at an International Athletic competition in Lahore, Pakistan.He hadn&#8217;t been back to Pakistan since fleeing in 1947 and initially refused to go.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How can a boy, who has seen his parents murdered before his eyes one night, their throats slashed in front of him, his brothers and sisters hacked to death, ever forget those images?&#8221; he says. But hearing that Singh wasn&#8217;t going to go to Pakistan, Nehru asked to see him and convinced him to change his mind. &#8220;He said to me,&#8217;They are our neighbours. We have to maintain our friendship and love with them. Sport fosters these things, therefore you should go.'&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Singh did go to Pakistan and recalls that when he crossed the border he saw children lining the road holding the flags of India and Pakistan &#8211; the welcome was &#8220;overwhelming&#8221;. His main rival in the event was Pakistan&#8217;s Abdul Khaliq. Newspapers and banners along the street in Lahore were describing it not only as a clash between these two athletes but as&#8221;a clash between Pakistan and India&#8221;.Despite the huge support for Khaliq in the stadium, Singh went on to win that race while Khaliq took the bronze medal. As Gen Ayub Khan, Pakistan&#8217;s second president, awarded the competitors their medals, Singh received the nickname that would stick with him for the rest of his life. &#8220;Gen Ayub said to me, &#8216;Milkha, you came to Pakistan and did not run. You actually flew in Pakistan. Pakistan bestows upon you the title of the Flying Sikh.&#8217; If Milkha Singh is known as the Flying Sikh in the whole world today, the credit goes to General Ayub and to Pakistan,&#8221;Singh says.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Now, nearly 55 years on, with more than 77 international race wins to his name and a successful Bollywood film made of his life story, the Flying Sikh still has one outstanding ambition. He wants to live to see an Indian win Olympic gold in a track and field event, adding to the country&#8217;s current haul of gold medals in hockey and shooting.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My greatest desire before I die is to see an Indian win the gold medal that I lost in the Olympics,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My last wish before leaving this world is to see an Indian athlete, male or female, shine and give me the opportunity to see India&#8217;s tricolour hoisted in the Olympic arena and hear the national anthem played there. This is my last wish.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong>“Surprised and deeply honoured” – our chief executive Harpal Singh Kumar receives a knighthood</strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b><strong> </strong></b>Cancer Research UK</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve had some great news today – our chief executive Harpal Kumar has <b><strong>received a knighthood</strong></b> for services to cancer research.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This wonderful announcement acknowledges the significant impact he has had at Cancer Research UK during more than a decade at the charity.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Under his tenure, we’ve funded breakthrough scientific discoveries and secured a range of life-saving policy changes – most recently, the charity’s campaigning has been instrumental in the introduction of standardised cigarette packaging.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And there are many other life-saving advances he has overseen, with just a few listed here:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Cancer Research UK co-funded a trial of Bowel Scope Screening (also called flexi-scope or flexible sigmoidoscopy), which could save thousands of lives a year when fully rolled out in2016. Pilots of Bowel Scope are under way in England, and soon everyone in England should be offered Bowel Scope Screening at 55, as well as the Faecal Occult Blood Test at 60.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our scientists have played a key role in developing drugs called PARP inhibitors to target cancers carrying certain genetic faults. Olaparib is the first of these drugs to be approved for treating certain ovarian cancer patients.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Harpal has over seen the launch in 2013 of the world’s largest study of lung cancer patients. This trial is helping understand how tumours respond to treatment and changeover time.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And in October this year, we launched the world’s largest clinical trial aiming to find out if aspirin can prevent some of the most common cancers coming back.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Cancer Research UK has also played a vital role in making sure more patients can have innovative radiotherapy treatments. For example, the number of patients in England who are able to have a modern type of radiotherapy called Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) has substantially increased thanks to the RadiotherapyInnovation Fund that we helped establish and deliver.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Harpal chaired the Independent CancerTaskforce, an exceptional opportunity to oversee the development of the new NHS strategy for cancer in England. The strategy set out what needs to be done to transform cancer services in England over the next five years, from improving prevention, early diagnosis and access to treatments to ensuring patients have a experience of their care. Although it was only published less than 6 months ago, numerous changes are already being put in place.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And following on from his role with the Cancer Task force, Harpal will now chair an Independent Advisory Group to advise and oversee progress of the new strategy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Harpal is dedicated to ensuring that patients are at the heart of everything we do. This can be clearly seen in our most recent research strategy, where he set out the ambition that three-quarters of people with cancer will survive the disease by 2034.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And under his leadership the amount of money the charity spends on life-saving cancer research has increased to £464 million in the last year.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I am very surprised and deeply honoured,” Harpal tells us. “It is a privilege to lead Cancer Research UK.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“More than anything,this Honour recognises the extraordinary innovation and dedication of our scientists and clinicians to beating cancer, the creativity and passion of our fundraisers and amazing volunteers – with their commitment to maintaining the highest standards – and the tenacity and belief of our policy and information professionals in driving change at all levels, and in providing outstanding support for cancer patients and their families.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I hope this Honour helps to both mark how far we have come in cancer, whilst also raising awareness of how far we have to go.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Sir Harpal became Cancer Research UK’s chief executive in 2007, following on from his role as chief operating officer of the charity, to which he was appointed in 2004. He was previously chief executive of Cancer Research UK’s commercial arm, Cancer Research Technology, in 2002.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">He is also a Trustee of the Francis Crick Institute, and chairs the National Awareness and Early Diagnosis Initiative.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">A picture has gone viral on social networks which shows a Sikh using his turban to help a bleeding victim until the paramedics arrived on the scene of an accident. The incident occurred at Manuroa Road, Takanini in Auckland, New Zealand.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A person familiar with the incident said,”A Young child was hit with car by someone at Manuroa Road,Takanini (Near Gurdwara Sahib) and was in critical conditions when a Young Sikh reached their, removed his Dastar (Turban) and helped to stop the bleeding of the victims.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">When interviewed by a local reporter he said, “I saw a child down on the ground and a lady was holding him.His head was bleeding, so I unveiled my turban and put it under his head.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I wasn’t thinking about the turban. I was thinking about the accident and I just thought, ‘He needs something on his head because he’s bleeding.’ That’s my job – to help.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And I think anyone else would have done the same as me.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The mother of the boy arrived shortly after.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"> Mr Singh said: “The little boy, he was talking to us before his mum came. He wasn’t crying. But when his mum arrived – when he saw her – he started to cry, because she was crying.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Another person who arrived on the scene stated, “There was enough help as there was,but being a Sikh myself, I know what type of respect the turban has. People just don’t take it off – people die over it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I saw him [Mr Singh] with no head covering and thought, ‘That’s strange’. But then I saw one hand was underneath the boy’s head supporting it and his siropao[turban] was stopping the bleeding.  ” … he didn’t care that his head was uncovered in public. He just wanted to help this little boy.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The boy was taken to the local hospital and was in stable condition.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While everyone was calm and providing aid to the boy. The mother was in panic mode.One of the witnesses stated, “”He was conscious. His eyes were open, he wasn’t moving – he wasn’t even groaning in pain. His sister was there … She was crying. Then her mum came. She didn’t say a word. She just ran to her son. She was freaking out.””</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Mandeep Singh</b><b> ( who saved six lives from a crashed burning plane) Honoured in Dubai</b><b><strong>   </strong></b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A few brave hearts alone cannot save people from death without a divine intervention, according to a Dubai resident who was instrumental in saving six people from a burning plane in Canada.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mandeep Singh Dhaliwal is humble enough to attribute his bravery to a miraculous intervention appeared in the form of a heavy wind when the small plane crashed on a busy highway in Richmond in British Columbia on October 27, 2011. “I was at a loss along with scores of others when we saw the plane in flames a few yards away and a heavy wind was intensifying the flames. The plane’s door was opened and two passengers jumped out of the flames. They were able to do so because the wind was in opposite direction of the door, keeping the flames away from the door,”Dhaliwal told Gulf News.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Had the wind was blowing along the door’s direction, the two passengers would have ever come out and we would never get the courage to approach the burning plane,” said the 32-year-old Indian IT Specialist in the Aviation sector, who was on a business trip to Canada when the incident occurred.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Ignoring the intense heat and dense smoke enveloping the aircraft, he and other rescuers entered the plane several times to help pull the injured passengers out.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">He was surprised to receive a call after a few months from a Canadian Government official, saying he was nominated for a bravery award. He was again surprised when he was invited to visit Canada to receive the award late in 2012. Six other rescuers were also awarded for their courage in the incident. But Dhaliwal could not visit Canada then, being busy with his works in India. He moved to Dubai in June 2014.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">When Arif Z Lalani, the Canadian Ambassador to the UAE, came to know Dhaliwal was living in Dubai, he organised Presentation Ceremony of the Canadian Decoration for Bravery on Saturday at the ambassador’s residence on Saturday (May 2). Lalani presented the award on behalf of David Johnston, Governor General of Canada.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Decorations for Bravery recognise people who risked their lives to try to save or protect another. The Decorations were created by Queen Elizabeth II in 1972. Th governor general personally presents the Decorations in ceremonies held at Rideau Hall, in Ottawa, or at La Citadelle, in Québec City. They consist of the Cross of Valour, the Star of Courage and the Medal of Bravery.<br />
Lalani said: “ Mr Dhaliwal is a hero. He reflects the essence of the Canadian Governor General’s medal for bravery – helping others simply because they need help and you can offer it. It is a great honour to present the medal to Mr Dhaliwal in the UAE where he lives and works.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Dhaliwal’s humbleness further attributes his bravery to his attire. “Being a Sikh, my turban might have helped others easily recognise me among other rescuers,” he told Gulf News. There were many others who also risked their life along with others, he said. Dhaliwal is working with Fly Dubai now and his wife Kamalpreet Kaur is a school teacher. The couple has a four-year-old son Nirvaan Singh.<br />
He has not been carried away by the award and ensuing flame. “Anyone trying to rescue others must ensure their own safety first. I did it because four other friends were also with me. I may do the same. But when we do so, we should take care of our safety too!” Dhaliwal said.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world’s oldest marathon runner will be one of the honorary starters at the first-ever Birmingham International Marathon on Sunday, October 15.</p>
<p>Known as the ‘Turbaned Tornado’, 106-year-old Fauja Singh BEM took up running when he was in his 80s after moving to London from Punjab in northern India.</p>
<p>Fauja shot to fame at the sprightly age of 89 when he completed a marathon in six hours and 54 minutes. This took 58 minutes off the previous world best in his age bracket.</p>
<p>In October 2011, Fauja became the first 100-year-old to complete a marathon when he crossed the finish line of the Toronto Waterfront Marathon in 8 hours and 11 minutes.</p>
<p>He was one of the torchbearers for the Athens Olympics in 2004, 2010 Commonwealth Games Baton Relay runner, and torchbearer for the London 2012 Olympic Games and in 2015 he was awarded a British Empire Medal in the New Year’s Honours for services to sport and charity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The running legend will be joined by another world-famous athlete at the Alexander Stadium start-line, Birmingham International Marathon ambassador Liz McColgan.</p>
<p>Scottish-born Liz is a two-time gold medallist over 10,000 metres at the Commonwealth Games and winner of the 1991 New York Marathon, 1992 Tokyo Marathon and 1996 London Marathon.</p>
<p>The appearances in Birmingham of Fauja Singh and Liz McColgan will help the city’s ambition to host the Commonwealth Games after the Government last week officially endorsed Birmingham’s bid to welcome the sports spectacular in 2022.</p>
<p>And to celebrate Fauja’s visit to Birmingham, his family are aiming to enrol 106 children from schools in the city for the Simplyhealth Great Birmingham Junior and Mini Runs, which take place on Saturday, October 14, the day before the 26.2-mile run.</p>
<p>The Birmingham International Marathon reached capacity months ago, with its 9,000 individual entry places snapped by runners from across the world.</p>
<p>Starting at the Alexander Stadium, the marathon takes in city sights such as Selfridges, Edgbaston Stadium, Cannon Hill Park and Bournville.</p>
<p>Fauja said: “I feel privileged in being part of Birmingham&#8217;s first International Marathon because it makes me feel as if I am still running myself.</p>
<p>“Although I felt I still had many running years left in me when my coach and family wisely made the decision to retire me from running, I am proud to be part of the diverse Birmingham community that has always shown me love whenever I visit this great city.</p>
<p>“I can already feel the positive energy of all the runners and their families too as they prepare to take on personal challenges as I used to before each race – I wish everyone the very best and can assure them that their elation after crossing the finishing line will be worth the months of effort they put into their training.”</p>
<p>The marathon takes place on the same day as the Simplyhealth Great Birmingham Run half marathon, which still has a limited amount of entry places available.</p>
<p>Entrants who sign up for this year’s Simplyhealth Great Birmingham Run are offered a guaranteed entry window for the Birmingham International Marathon 2018 to make sure they do not miss out on what is already one of the country’s top six 26.2-mile runs.</p>
<p>Harmander Singh, Fauja’s running coach, added: “When I learnt that Fauja was going to be the starter for Birmingham&#8217;s first International Marathon, as his coach I just had to enter the race myself.</p>
<p>“As the Club President of ‘Sikhs In The City’ (Fauja Singh’s running club) which, like Birmingham, is the most diverse running club in the country with members from nine different faiths, I wanted to lead the way for our club members and have ensured many from the club also take part.”</p>
